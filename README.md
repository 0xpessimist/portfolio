### About Me

Hi, I'm Eren, otherwise known as "pessimist". I am a 21 y/o Blockchain Security Researcher, ex-Game Designer at [Voodoo](http://voodoo.io/), occasionally contributing [Pioneer Labs](https://www.pioneerlabs.dev/).

Currently focused on bug bounty hunting; also doing private audits with the [Dup1337](https://x.com/0xDup1337) team. 
I can provide in-depth auditing and secure development of Solidity & Cairo smart contracts and Cosmos-SDK blockchains.

For security reviews or consulting, please reach out to me on
